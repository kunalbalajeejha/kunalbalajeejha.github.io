The last post was 6 years back and it was the first post.

This time I am thinking of keeping a regular small updates on technical issue I have encountered and solutions which I have found for them.

**Problem** : For a project find I need to show nested progress bars. The first bar for a Flight level progress and second bar I needed for the PNR level progress.

**Solution** : There are [multiple libraries][awesome] available in Go lang but the one I could use was [Multi Progress Bar][mpb]. 

The code snippet is given below :

{% highlight go %}
p := mpb.New()
name := "Flights :"
bar := p.AddBar(int64(len(flightList)), 
		mpb.PrependDecorators(			
			decor.StaticName(name, len(name), 0),
	),)

for _,flight := range flightList{
	
	pnrs := getPNRList(flight)
	name2 := "PNRs for "+flight.Carrier+strconv.Itoa(flight.FlightNumber)
	bar2 := p.AddBar(int64(len(pnrs)), 
		mpb.PrependDecorators(			
			decor.StaticName(name2, len(name2), 0),
	),)
	for _, pnr := range pnrs{
		addOSIComments(pnr,flight)
		bar2.Increment()
	}
	bar.Increment()
}
p.Stop()
{% endhighlight %}
