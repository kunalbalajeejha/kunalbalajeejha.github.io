{"name":"Changing Phone Number in Address Book","tagline":"Github Pages for Kunal","body":"I have recently travelled from Singapore to Chennai. And all my contact numbers are having the number \"019\" added infront of them. This was done, so as to get the cheaper rates when calling to India. Now that I am back in India, I was faced with the task of manually (either on Mac or iPhone) replacing all the number \"019\" with \"+\" sign in my contacts.\r\nThen I remembered about *AppleScript* and how I can easily do this with a little bit of programming.\r\nThe result is the below peice of code. In this process I also re-discovered the [Mac OSX Automation](http://www.macosxautomation.com) website, which has the sub-routine for [text search and replace](http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/sbrt/sbrt-06.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\ton replace_chars(this_text, search_string, replacement_string)\r\n\t\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to the search_string\r\n\t\tset the item_list to every text item of this_text\r\n\t\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to the replacement_string\r\n\t\tset this_text to the item_list as string\r\n\t\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\r\n\t\treturn this_text\r\n\tend replace_chars\r\n\t\r\n\ttell application \"Address Book\"\r\n\t\trepeat with i from 1 to (count every person)\r\n\t\t\tset phoneProperties to properties of phones of person i\r\n\t\t\trepeat with j from 1 to (count of phoneProperties)\r\n\t\t\t\tif value of item j of phoneProperties contains \"019\" then\r\n\t\t\t\t\tset phoneNumber to value of item j of phoneProperties\r\n\t\t\t\t\tset the phoneNumber to replace_chars(phoneNumber, \"019\", \"+\") of me\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlog phoneNumber\r\n\t\t\t\t\tset value of item j of phones of person i to phoneNumber\r\n\t\t\t\tend if\r\n\t\t\tend repeat\r\n\t\tend repeat\r\n\t\tsave\r\n\tend tell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-27323066-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
